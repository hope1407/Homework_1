## Description

When viewing the previous HTML for Horiseon's webpage, one would've found it cluttered full of div-tags, and all images alt-tagless.  When viewing the HMTL now however, you will see that all div tags have been replaced with clear and appropriate semantic tags.  You will also find that every image has had a helpful alt-tag added so that the page is more accessible.
